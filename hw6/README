This assignment took me about 8-10 hours to complete, due to other tests and homework, I wasn't able to get the textures to work properly until the last few hours. I managed to get everything but the propeller. With some more time after the due date I will get that done as well. For now I suppose that the propeller is spinning so a texture is hard to see anyways..
